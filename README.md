# SDL Swing Copters

WIP port of the mobile game *Swing Copters* to SDL.  
This was a pet project and has been cluttering up my laptop for a bit now,  
figured I might as well throw it in source control.  
Article on the original game: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_Copters

## Legal Stuff

The code is MIT licensed but I don't own the rights to Swing Copters
nor am I affiliated with the Swing Copter devs in any way.
